## NN Classification
All results from our classification analysis on the Winsconsing Breast Cancer
data can be reproduced by uncommenting and running the different sections in
test_analysis.py. The analysis was done with our own implementation of a Feed
Forward Neural Network 

## Logistic Regression Classification
To reproduce the results from our classification analysis with Logistic
Regression, uncomment and run the different sections in
test_logistic_regression.py. Our Logistic Regression code is just a subset of our
Neural Network with 0 hidden Layers.
